# Requirements
Helix runs off multiple JavaScript and Node libraries. These being:
1) NodeJS
2) DiscordJS
3) Nodemon
4) Github-Api
5) HypixelAPI-JS
6) Cleverbot
7) Destiny2-API-JS

# Other
This is a stripped down version of the bot, there is some modules
missing on purpose for multiple reasons. None of the backend stuff
that handles it going through servers and networking is included in
this version. This repo main purporse is to help people building 
their bots.

Something here will trigger ConnorLinfoot.....DEAL WITH IT CONNOR.
