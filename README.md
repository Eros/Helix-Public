# Helix
Helix is a bot for Discord servers written in NodeJS. To contribute to this project please fork and make a pull request. Bugs will go under the issues tab.

# Requirements
Helix runs off multiple JavaScript and Node libraries. These being:
1) NodeJS
2) DiscordJS
3) Nodemon
4) Github-Api
5) HypixelAPI-JS
6) Cleverbot
7) Destiny2-API-JS

# Other
This is a stripped down version of the bot, there is some modules
missing on purpose for multiple reasons. None of the backend stuff
that handles it going through servers and networking is included in
this version. This repo main purporse is to help people building 
their bots.

Anything in node_modules is not written by me. These are seperate
libraries made by other people that are used by either me, node 
or other libs.

Something here will trigger ConnorLinfoot.....DEAL WITH IT CONNOR.
